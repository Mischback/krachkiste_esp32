API
###

The project is split into several modules, which are implemented as **ESP-IDF**
components.

This documentation is generated using a toolchain of
`Doxygen <https://doxygen.nl/>`_ (to extract the actual documentation from the
source code), `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/>`_ (to build the documentation
from ``rST`` sources) and `breathe <https://www.breathe-doc.org/>`_ (bridges the
gap between *Doxygen* and *Sphinx*).
